# 4448_Proj2  
## Strategy & Observer Zoo  
Team: Chace Trevino, Joseph Wilson  

### Assumptions  
We assumed that the random behavior of certain animals from project 1 would carry over to this project and that this behavior should be reflected in the use case for the Zoo Keeper.

### Issues
We had to look up how to create an observable object and an observer with propertyChangeListener. We also had to consult the lecture notes for other aspects of strategy methodology and the UML diagrams.  

### Special Instructions  
Lines 89-90 in Proj2.java should be uncommented in order to output the text of the zoo activities to a file.
